# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

In the future I would like to implement an animated logo. So instead of the static coffee pot in the upper left hand corner, I would like to add an animated coffee pot with steam comming out the top.
